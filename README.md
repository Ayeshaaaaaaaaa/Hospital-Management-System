# Hospital Management System

## Introduction

This project is in java, project is build on oop principles.This hospital management system includes three main sections: Admin, Department, and Pharmacy. In the Admin section, registration of doctors and patients is conducted, and lists of doctors and patients are viewable based on the departments they are affiliated with or admitted to. The hospital comprises five major departments: Cardiology, Neurology, Dentistry, Eye, and Labs, along with additional emergency rooms such as Operating Theater and ICU/CCU.

In the Department section, information about each department, operating rooms, and various labs is available, along with the services, facilities, and treatments provided.

The Pharmacy section allows the addition and viewing of medicines for different departments. Medicines are organized department-wise for easy access and maintenance of records.

Records are managed using concepts of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, and file handling is employed to handle and maintain all records in the system. Object-Oriented Programming concepts are extensively utilized in this JAVA-based system.

## Modules Of Hospital Management System

The system is secured with a login function, allowing only authorized personnel with correct usernames and passwords to access it. There are three main modules:

### Admin Module:

Admins have the authority to add doctors and patients, as well as view their records. Every new doctor or patient entered into the system is added to the respective department's list. Patient information such as disease, previous history, and biodata is recorded, along with doctor details including working hours and specialization.

### Department Module:

This module provides information about each department, operating rooms, and various labs, including the services, facilities, and treatments offered.

### Pharmacy Module:

Users can add or view medicines for various departments. Medicine names and usage details are stored in files, with every new medicine added to the respective department's medicine file. E.g In Heart medicine file there are all medicines for curing heart problems.

Different loops are employed to enhance the efficiency and user-friendliness of the management system.
